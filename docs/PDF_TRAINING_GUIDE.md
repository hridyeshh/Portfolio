# PDF Resume Training Guide

## âœ… **Successfully Implemented!**

Your AI assistant now reads and uses your resume PDF data. Here's what we accomplished:

### **What We Built:**

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from your resume PDF
2. **Data Cleaning**: Formats and organizes the extracted information
3. **AI Integration**: Adds your resume data to the AI context
4. **Smart Responses**: AI now answers with your actual resume information

### **How It Works:**

```
PDF Upload â†’ Text Extraction â†’ Data Cleaning â†’ AI Integration â†’ Smart Responses
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Process:**

### **Step 1: PDF Upload**
- Place your resume PDF in the project directory
- Name it `hridyesh_resume.pdf` (or update the filename in the script)

### **Step 2: Text Extraction**
```bash
# Run the PDF processor
node pdf_processor.js
```
This extracts raw text from your PDF and saves it to `resume_content.txt`

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning**
```bash
# Clean and format the extracted data
node clean_resume_data.js
```
This creates `cleaned_resume_data.txt` with properly formatted information

### **Step 4: AI Integration**
The cleaned data is automatically integrated into your AI assistant's context

### **Step 5: Testing**
```bash
# Test the AI with resume-based questions
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"What is your educational background?"}'
```

- "What is your educational background?"
- "What university did you attend?"
- "What's your degree in?"

### **Experience & Skills:**
- "Tell me about your experience at Limeroad"
- "What are your key technical skills?"
- "What programming languages do you know?"

### **Achievements & Metrics:**
- "What are your key technical achievements?"
- "Tell me about your research work"
- "What metrics have you achieved?"

### **Projects:**
- "What projects have you worked on?"
- "Tell me about your AR project"
- "What's your experience with machine learning?"

## ðŸ”„ **How to Update Your Resume:**

### **Option 1: Replace PDF**
1. Replace `hridyesh_resume.pdf` with your new resume
2. Run: `node pdf_processor.js`
3. Run: `node clean_resume_data.js`
4. Restart the server

### **Option 2: Manual Update**
1. Edit `cleaned_resume_data.txt` directly
2. Copy the content to `server.js` in the `portfolioContext`
3. Restart the server

### **Option 3: Direct Server Edit**
1. Edit the resume data directly in `server.js`
2. Restart the server

## ðŸš€ **Advanced Features:**

### **Automatic Updates:**
```javascript
// Add this to server.js for automatic PDF processing
const fs = require('fs');
const PDFProcessor = require('./pdf_processor.js');

// Check for PDF updates every hour
setInterval(async () => {
    const processor = new PDFProcessor();
    await processor.processResume('hridyesh_resume.pdf');
}, 3600000);
```

### **Multiple Resume Support:**
```javascript
// Support multiple resume versions
const resumeVersions = {
    'technical': 'technical_resume.pdf',
    'academic': 'academic_resume.pdf',
    'general': 'hridyesh_resume.pdf'
};
```

### **Dynamic Context Loading:**
```javascript
// Load resume data dynamically based on query
function getRelevantResumeContext(query) {
    const keywords = query.toLowerCase().split(' ');
    
    if (keywords.includes('research') || keywords.includes('paper')) {
        return 'Focus on research achievements and publications';
    }
    if (keywords.includes('mobile') || keywords.includes('android')) {
        return 'Focus on mobile development experience';
    }
    // ... more conditions
}
```

## ðŸ“Š **Response Quality Examples:**

### **Before (Generic):**
> "I have experience in software development and various technologies."

### **After (Resume-Based):**
> "I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Mathematics and Computing from Netaji Subhas University of Technology, graduating in 2025. My coursework provided a strong foundation in both theoretical computer science and practical software development, which I've successfully applied in my internships and personal projects."

### **Before (Vague):**
> "I worked on some projects and achieved good results."

### **After (Specific):**
> "I consistently deliver impactful results. For example, at Limeroad, I reduced user navigation time by 40% by integrating the Vmart storefront using Kotlin MVVM, and decreased checkout drop-offs by 25% by engineering a modern 'AddAddress' screen. My work on a fuzzy search system achieved 95% accuracy with sub-50ms response times."

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits:**

1. **Accurate Information**: AI uses your actual resume data
2. **Specific Metrics**: Includes real achievements and numbers
3. **Professional Tone**: Maintains your voice and style

```bash
# Install pdf-parse if not already installed
npm install pdf-parse
```

### **Server Not Responding:**
```bash
# Restart the server
pkill -f "node server.js"
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key node server.js
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test thoroughly** with various questions
