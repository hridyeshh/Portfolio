## Method 2: Fine-tuning with Google Gemini (Advanced)

### Prerequisites:
- Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
- Vertex AI API enabled
- Sufficient quota for fine-tuning

### Step 1: Prepare Training Data

Create a JSON file with conversation examples:

```json
{
  "training_data": [
    {
      "input": "What are your technical skills?",
      "output": "I'm proficient in mobile development using Kotlin and Java, building robust Android applications with Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and Clean Architecture. My backend expertise includes Python, Flask, and SQL, where I've optimized database schemas to improve query performance by up to 60%. I also have extensive experience with front-end technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS."
    },
    {
      "input": "Tell me about your experience at Limeroad",
      "output": "At Limeroad, I significantly improved the user experience by integrating the Vmart storefront into app navigation using Kotlin and MVVM, reducing user navigation time by 40%. I engineered a new 'Add Address' screen using Material3 and Android 13 location APIs, resulting in a 25% decrease in checkout drop-offs. This demonstrates my ability to translate technical expertise directly into tangible business improvements."
    },
    {
      "input": "What makes you unique as a developer?",
      "output": "I bring a unique perspective to software development—I view code as storytelling. This allows me to craft not only functional but also elegant, maintainable, and readable solutions. My background in writing and poetry informs my approach to problem-solving, resulting in code that's clear, concise, and impactful."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Create Training Dataset

```bash
# Using Google Cloud CLI
gcloud ai custom-jobs create \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --display-name="portfolio-assistant-training" \
  --worker-pool-spec=machine-type=n1-standard-4,replica-count=1,container-image-uri=gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/training/tf-cpu.2-8:latest
```

### Step 3: Fine-tune the Model

```python
# Python script for fine-tuning
from google.cloud import aiplatform

def create_fine_tuning_job():
    aiplatform.init(project='your-project-id')
    
    job = aiplatform.CustomTrainingJob(
        display_name="portfolio-assistant-finetune",
        script_path="training_script.py",
        container_uri="gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/training/tf-cpu.2-8:latest",
        requirements=["google-cloud-aiplatform"],
        model_serving_container_image_uri="gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/prediction/tf2-cpu.2-8:latest"
    )
    
    job.run(
        dataset=dataset,
        model_display_name="portfolio-assistant-model"
    )
```

## Method 3: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Approach

### Benefits:
- Can include your full resume as context
- More flexible than fine-tuning
- Easier to update with new information

### Implementation:

#### Step 1: Create Resume Embeddings
```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from google.cloud import aiplatform

def create_resume_embeddings():
    genai.configure(api_key='your-api-key')
    
    # Load your resume text
    with open('resume.txt', 'r') as f:
        resume_text = f.read()
    
    # Create embeddings
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
    embeddings = model.embed_content(resume_text)
    
    return embeddings
```

#### Step 2: Implement RAG in Server
```javascript
// Add to server.js
const resumeEmbeddings = require('./resume-embeddings.json');

async function getRelevantContext(query) {
    // Use semantic search to find relevant resume sections
    const relevantSections = await searchResume(query, resumeEmbeddings);
    return relevantSections;
}

app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
    const { query } = req.body;
    
    // Get relevant resume context
    const resumeContext = await getRelevantContext(query);
    
    // Combine with portfolio context
    const fullContext = `${portfolioContext}\n\nResume Context:\n${resumeContext}\n\nUser: ${query}\n\nAssistant:`;
    
    // Call Gemini API with enhanced context
    // ... rest of the code
});
```

## Method 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Combine Multiple Techniques:

1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering** (Current)
2. **Resume Integration** (Add your full resume as context)
3. **Conversation Examples** (Add more Q&A pairs)
4. **Industry-Specific Responses** (Tailor for different roles)

### Implementation Steps:

#### Step 1: Add Your Resume
```javascript
// Add to portfolioContext in server.js
RESUME CONTENT:
[Paste your full resume text here with proper formatting]

INTERVIEW PREPARATION:
- Common Questions: [Add 10-15 common interview questions]
- Behavioral Examples: [STAR method responses]
- Technical Challenges: [Specific technical problems you've solved]
- Leadership Examples: [Team projects, mentoring, etc.]
```

#### Step 2: Create Response Templates
```javascript
// Add response templates for different scenarios
RESPONSE TEMPLATES:
- Skills Question: "I'm proficient in [technologies] with [specific achievements]"
- Experience Question: "At [company], I [specific action] which resulted in [measurable outcome]"
- Project Question: "I developed [project] using [technologies] that [business impact]"
- Culture Fit: "I believe in [values] and demonstrate this through [examples]"
```

#### Step 3: Add Dynamic Context
```javascript
// Add logic to include relevant resume sections based on query
function getRelevantResumeSections(query) {
    const keywords = query.toLowerCase().split(' ');
    
    // Map keywords to resume sections
    const sectionMap = {
        'android': 'mobile development experience',
        'kotlin': 'programming languages and frameworks',
        'python': 'backend development and data science',
        'react': 'frontend development and web technologies',
        // Add more mappings
    };
    
    return keywords.map(keyword => sectionMap[keyword]).filter(Boolean);
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Create Test Cases:
```javascript
const testCases = [
    {
        question: "What are your strongest technical skills?",
        expectedKeywords: ["Kotlin", "Android", "Python", "React"]
    },
    {
        question: "Tell me about a challenging project",
        expectedKeywords: ["Email Oasis", "80%", "FurniAR", "AR"]
    },
    {
        question: "Why should we hire you?",
        expectedKeywords: ["storytelling", "unique", "perspective"]
    }
];
```

### Monitor Response Quality:
```javascript
// Add to server.js for monitoring
app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Log response quality metrics
    console.log(`Query: "${query}"`);
    console.log(`Response length: ${aiResponse.length}`);
    console.log(`Contains metrics: ${aiResponse.includes('%')}`);
    console.log(`Uses 'I' statements: ${aiResponse.includes('I ')}`);
    
    // ... rest of code
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the current improved responses
2. **Short-term**: Add your full resume to the context
3. **Medium-term**: Implement RAG approach
4. **Long-term**: Consider fine-tuning if needed

## Cost Considerations

- **Current approach**: Free (uses existing API calls)
- **RAG approach**: Minimal cost (embedding storage)
- **Fine-tuning**: $500-2000+ depending on model size and training time

The current enhanced prompt engineering approach should give you excellent results for most use cases!
